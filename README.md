### Hey there 👋

I’m Artur, a Computer Science student based in Barcelona. 

I’m currently working on a small cute robot with personality that is aware of its surroundings, and on a very particular-looking 3D escape room.

I need to build things that mix software + creativity, so my brain doesn't rot.
