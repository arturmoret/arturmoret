#### Hi there 👋

I’m Artur Moret González, a Computer Science student based in Barcelona. 

I love building things that mix software + creativity, so my brain doesn't rot.

I'm currently working on a little cute robot with personality that is aware of its surroundings and a very particular-looking 3D escape room.
